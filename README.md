# Description
This is an open space organizer project.
- Assign colleagues/persons randomly to a table in a room
- This way you can get to know your fellow workers better
- Python-based

The original project idea can be found here:
https://github.com/brain8d/BXL-Bouman-7/tree/main/projects/01-openspace-organizer


# Installation
To install the open space organizer, simply download this repository and run the main.py file
Tested on Python 3.12

# Usage
The open space oragnizer will allow you to create a seating arrangement for you and your colleagues.
Assignment to different tables will be random. This can be an excellent way to get to know your fellow colleagues better!

The default open space plan is a room of 6 tables with 4 chairs each. Further features are under development.
The nice-to-have features version will be available under a different branch when finished

The program takes as input the filepath of  an excel document (.xlsx)
with a list of 24 people in the first column.

Once the program is running you will have a few options:

```
Options: 
0 exit
1 display different tables and their occupants
2 get free seats in room
3 number of people in room
```
